I believe that everyone who has had contact with statistical tools has heard of the famous Poisson distribution. Especially when we talk about generalized linear models (GLM). This famous probability distribution is always used when you want to model counts, but it has its weaknesses. The main one is the maladjustment to a database that has overdispersion, that is when the variance of the data is greater than the average.

Just to remember, when $$ X $$ has Poisson distribution with parameter $$ \theta $$, so its mean and variance have the same value, that is, $$ \mathbb{E}[X] = \mathbb{VAR}[X] = \theta $$. But if $$ \mathbb{E}[X] <\mathbb{VAR}[X] $$ the Poisson distribution would not be suitable for this data, do you agree? And this is what we call overdispersion. Well, normally for these cases, the Negative Binomial distribution provides good results adding to the model one more parameter that is responsible for adjusting the overdispersion.

However, at the end of 2017, Fredy Castellares published a paper presenting a new distribution for counting data that has only one parameter and is capable of modeling data with super dispersion. What I'm going to do now is introduce you to this new distribution and its respective regression model, in the simplest possible way.

The Bell distribution emerged considering the following expansion provided by Bell

$$
\exp(e^x-1) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{B_n}{n!}x^n; \hspace{5mm} x \in \mathbb{R},
$$

where the coefficients $$B_n$$ are the Bell numbers defined by

$$
B_n = \frac{1}{e}\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{k^n}{k!},
$$

starting with $$B_0 =B_1 =1$$.


The Bell number ($$B_n$$) in the above equation is the $$n$$th moment of the Poisson distribution with parameter equal to 1, and considering these equation it's possible define the Bell distribution. So, a discrete random variable $$Y$$ has a Bell distribution with parameter $$\theta$$ if its probability mass function is given by

$$
\mathbb{P}(Y = y) = \frac{\theta^y e^{-(e^\theta-1)}B_y}{y!} \hspace{5mm} y=0,1,2,\dots,
$$

with $$\theta>0$$, and $$B_y$$ are the Bell numbers.
