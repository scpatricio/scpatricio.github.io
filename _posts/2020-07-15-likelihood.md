It is no secret that statistics is a science widely used in several areas as a tool for data analysis. But this science is not only used, it is also developed in numerous areas, such as engineering, computer science, psychology, demography, social sciences and several others.

Fisher was a great example of this, this guy was a genius who lived until the middle of the 20th century, and he practically created the basis for modern statistics. But that is not my point about Fisher, what I want to draw your attention to is that he was a geneticist (you read that right, he was a geneticist) and not a statistician. Fisher is one of the greatest examples that statistics is a democratic science, which is not developed only by those with a statistical backgraund.

But the purpose of this post is not to talk about Fisher, but to explain what a likelihood function is and what it represents. I've been in academia since 2012, and I always realize that there are still a lot of people who don't know what a likelihood function is, or what it represents. So the idea of this post is to clarify that. Then come with me!
