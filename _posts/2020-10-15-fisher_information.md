Hi you! Here I'm going to talk to you a little bit about Fisher's Information. If you're reading this post, I'm sure you've heard of it, and can now appreciate the beautiful classic theory of mathematical statistics about the likelihood function. But let's not lose focus, and let's talk about Fisher's Information. For starters, do you know what formula is down here?

$$
\mathbb{E}\left[ \left( \frac{\partial \log f(X|\theta)}{\partial \theta} \right)^2 \right]
$$

I see ya in the next post, or on [twitter](http://twitter.com/scpatricio){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
