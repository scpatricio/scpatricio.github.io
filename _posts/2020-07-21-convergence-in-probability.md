A few weeks ago I presented the paper _Comparing support vector machines with Gaussian kernels to radial basis function classifiers_ in a webinar on Support Vector Machine (SVM). In this paper, to guarantee some necessary conditions in the theory of statistical learning, Schölkopf made use of the law of large numbers and also of some properties derived from the convergence in probability. And when I commented on this, I realized that the public was not familiar with the statistical theory, and that it might be necessary to present it.
