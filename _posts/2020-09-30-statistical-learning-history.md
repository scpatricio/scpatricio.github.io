A few weeks ago I started reading The Elements of Statistical Learning again, a book that I think is the best one to start really venturing into the world of statistical learning. And then I came across the history of statistical learning. I thought the story of how it all started and the first method presented in the 19th century was fantastic, and I thought, “man, people need to know that”. And here I am, to share this story and also a little bit about the method that is considered as the first statistical learning method. Let's do it.

I have to confess that for me this wave of data science that we are experiencing now, is nothing more than the popularization of various statistical methods that were created centuries ago. And this is great, because now we have more people interested in developing and improving statistical techniques, which results in a boom in the development of this science.

Finally, after several years, statistics are being recognized as science, and not just as a tool, as they have been until the last decade. Finally, the glorification of statistics.
